## About

Finds national park passport stamps for you based on your state. Due to the implementation of the API, returned data for a state includes parks, trails, places that can span across the entire US. Thus data filtering was required to show the most relevant information. The API is also not the most accurate source of data for the stamp locations. That can be found [here](https://americasnationalparks.org/passport-to-your-national-parks/passport-cancellation-locations/)

## Key Technology

- [NPS API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm) providing data for the passport stamp locations.
- [pico css](https://picocss.com/) a minimal css framework with simple opinionated html tag styling.
